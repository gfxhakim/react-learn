### 💡 Concept to Test: **Conditional Rendering + State + Event Handling**

> **🎯 Challenge (Interview Question Style):**  
> *“Create a `ToggleMessage` component. It should display “Hello, World!” by default. When the user clicks a button, it toggles to show “Goodbye, World!” and vice versa. Use functional components and hooks.”*

✅ **What I’m Testing:**
- Can you use `useState` to manage toggle state?
- Can you handle a click event?
- Can you conditionally render different text?



📝 **Your Turn!**  
Write your code below (or describe your approach). I’ll wait… then give you detailed feedback!

*(Example starter if you’re stuck:)*
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleMessage() {
  // Your code here...
}
```

Let’s see your code! 👇
