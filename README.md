# 🧭 React Learning Roadmap v19 — Master TOC 🚀  
> *Structured. Modern. Interview-Ready. Zero fluff. All signal.*

---

## 📚 Table of Contents — Topic by Topic


### 🧱 I. Core React Concepts  
> *The foundation — if this cracks, everything falls. Nail it first.*

- `01` → **Components (Functional & Class)** — `#jsx #components #basics`  
  _“Know both, use functional — but don’t blank on class in interviews.”_

- `02` → **JSX Syntax Deep Dive** — `#syntax #html-in-js #gotchas`  
  _“It’s not HTML. It’s not JavaScript. It’s JSX — and it’s magical.”_

- `03` → **Props & State** — `#data-flow #unidirectional #immutability`  
  _“Props = read-only gifts. State = your component’s mood ring.”_

- `04` → **Lifecycle (Class) / useEffect (Functional)** — `#mount #update #cleanup`  
  _“Class lifecycles are legacy. useEffect is the new king — with dependencies.”_

- `05` → **Event Handling** — `#onClick #forms #synthetic-events`  
  _“Handle clicks, changes, submits — without memory leaks or chaos.”_

- `06` → **Conditional Rendering** — `#&& #ternary #render-logic`  
  _“Show this, hide that — without breaking the virtual DOM.”_

- `07` → **Lists & Keys** — `#map #key-prop #reconciliation`  
  _“Keys aren’t optional. They’re how React tracks your sanity.”_

---

### 🪝 II. React Hooks (Modern Standard)  
> *Hooks are not optional. They’re your superpower. Master them.*

- `01` → **useState** — `#state #setter #functional-components`  
  _“The ‘S’ in SPA — simple, but easy to misuse.”_

- `02` → **useEffect** — `#side-effects #cleanup #deps-array`  
  _“The most misunderstood hook. We’ll fix that.”_

- `03` → **useContext** — `#global-state #provider #consumer`  
  _“Avoid prop drilling. Pass data like a whisper through components.”_

- `04` → **useReducer** — `#complex-state #actions #dispatch`  
  _“useState’s big sibling — for when state gets spicy.”_

- `05` → **useCallback & useMemo** — `#optimization #memoization #performance`  
  _“Stop re-creating functions and values on every render. Please.”_

- `06` → **useRef** — `#dom-access #mutable-values #no-re-render`  
  _“For when you need to poke the DOM or store values secretly.”_

- `07` → **Custom Hooks** — `#reusability #logic-extraction #abstraction`  
  _“Your secret weapon for clean, reusable, testable logic.”_

---

### 🧳 III. State Management  
> *When props aren’t enough — and your app starts screaming.*

- `01` → **Lifting State Up** — `#shared-state #parent-component #beginner-pattern`  
  _“The OG state pattern — still valid, still useful.”_

- `02` → **Context API (Global State)** — `#theme #auth #language`  
  _“Built-in global state — no libraries, no fuss.”_

- `03` → **Redux Toolkit (or Zustand/Jotai)** — `#rtk #zustand #jotai #external-state`  
  _“When Context isn’t enough — scale like a pro.”_
  - Actions, Reducers, Store
  - useSelector, useDispatch
  - RTK Query (bonus: data fetching baked in)

---

### 🛣️ IV. Routing (React Router v6+)  
> *Make your app feel like an app — not a single page scroll-fest.*

- `01` → **BrowserRouter, Routes, Route** — `#setup #declarative #v6`  
  _“The holy trinity of React Router — learn it once, use forever.”_

- `02` → **Dynamic Routing & URL Params** — `#useParams #:id #dynamic-segments`  
  _“/users/123? Yeah, we got that.”_

- `03` → **Navigation (Link, useNavigate)** — `#client-side #programmatic #redirects`  
  _“Click to go somewhere. Or code it. Your call.”_

- `04` → **Nested Routes & Layouts** — `#outlets #nested-ui #shared-layouts`  
  _“Build dashboards, settings panels, multi-level UIs — elegantly.”_

---

### 🚀 V. Advanced Patterns & Performance  
> *Flex your senior dev muscles. Impress interviewers. Sleep better.*

- `01` → **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** — `#wrappers #reuse #legacy-but-useful`  
  _“Old school? Maybe. Still powerful? Absolutely.”_

- `02` → **Render Props** — `#children-as-function #flexible #alternative-to-hoc`  
  _“Pass a function as children? Wild. Useful? Very.”_

- `03` → **Code Splitting (React.lazy + Suspense)** — `#performance #bundle-size #lazy-load`  
  _“Load only what you need — speed up your app like magic.”_

- `04` → **Error Boundaries** — `#try-catch-ui #componentdidcatch #graceful-fail`  
  _“Don’t let one crash burn the whole app. Catch it. Handle it. Log it.”_

- `05` → **Virtualization (react-window)** — `#lists #performance #10k-items`  
  _“Rendering 10,000 items? No lag. Just smooth scroll.”_

---

### 📡 VI. Data Fetching & Side Effects  
> *Where your app talks to the real world — and survives it.*

- `01` → **Fetch / Axios in useEffect** — `#api #side-effects #cleanup`  
  _“The classic. Still relevant. Still easy to mess up.”_

- `02` → **Async/Await Patterns** — `#promises #async #error-handling`  
  _“Write async code that doesn’t look like spaghetti.”_

- `03` → **Loading & Error States** — `#ui-states #skeletons #user-feedback`  
  _“Users hate waiting. Show them you care.”_

- `04` → **React Query (TanStack Query)** — `#server-state #caching #auto-refetch`  
  _“The game-changer. Stop managing loading states manually.”_

---

### 🎨 VII. Styling in React  
> *Make it pretty. Make it consistent. Make it maintainable.*

- `01` → **CSS Modules** — `#scoped #local #no-class-collisions`  
  _“CSS that doesn’t leak. Like shadow DOM, but simpler.”_

- `02` → **Styled Components / Emotion** — `#css-in-js #dynamic #theming`  
  _“Style with JavaScript. Love it or hate it — you’ll see it everywhere.”_

- `03` → **Tailwind CSS** — `#utility-first #rapid-ui #design-system`  
  _“Build fast. Look pro. No design skills required (mostly).”_

---

### 🧪 VIII. Testing  
> *Because “it works on my machine” is not a deployment strategy.*

- `01` → **Unit Testing with Jest** — `#assertions #mocks #coverage`  
  _“Test your logic. Isolate your functions. Sleep peacefully.”_

- `02` → **Component Testing with React Testing Library** — `#rtl #user-centric #accessibility`  
  _“Test like a user — not like a machine. Find what breaks IRL.”_

---

### 🧰 IX. Ecosystem & Tooling  
> *The invisible layer that makes everything work — don’t ignore it.*

- `01` → **Create React App vs Vite** — `#tooling #speed #modern`  
  _“CRA is comfy. Vite is lightning. Choose wisely.”_

- `02` → **Understanding package.json** — `#scripts #deps #devdeps`  
  _“More than just dependencies — it’s your project’s DNA.”_

- `03` → **ESLint & Prettier** — `#code-quality #formatting #team-rules`  
  _“Stop arguing about semicolons. Automate it. Move on.”_
